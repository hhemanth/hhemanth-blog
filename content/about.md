I started this blog as a way to share things I have learnt and learn so that I can share. I work on Ruby on Rails, so I will be writing mostly on Ruby on Rails. You might be wondering, another Ruby on Rails blog? Why? There are so many out there. 

You are right in a way. There is not much I can write thats not written already. But I would like to try, writing from my experience and covering topics I feel are needed if you want to genuinely improve yourself continuously and catapult yourself to the TOP 10 percent, 3 percent or 1 percent. It is the journey of continuous improvement that is more enjoyable than the destination itself.

Initially I will be writing on the following.

* **Enumerables Deep Dive** - I am going to take problems I have typically faced as a developer and presnt the problem and the solution here. These are patterns of problems that you may face in the future. I dont know how many parts there will be of this, It can be 3, 5 , or even 10.
* **Active Record Querying** - Same as above. I am going to take examples, do a deep dive on how to use Active record effectively. I will also show how to combine Active Record Queries and Enumerables methods to write code which easy to read and maintain and fast to run.
* **Setting up a CI/CD pipeline** - In some companies you will have a separate devops team which would setup a CI/CD pipeline but it doesn't hurt to understand how to set it up. I will use Jenkins and Capistrano. I may also try Ansible.
* **Refactoring and writing clean code** -
